RMI - Remote Method Invocation :
================================

        * Used to distribute the class object through out the clients
          connected in RemoteServer.

        * Used to develop a intra-net application(Client-Server application).

Architecture of RMI :
---------------------

ClassObject ---> Server ---> Skeleton --->  StubClass --->  Client


Procedure for developing RMI Application :
------------------------------------------
ServerSide :
------------

1) Create a Remote interface which contains collection of member functions (remote methods) declaration those will be defined in Remote Class.
2) Create a Remote class ,and inherit Remote interface & define all remote interface methods (javac remoteservlerclass.java)
3) Create Stub & Skeleton classes for created Remote Class (Using rmic.exe syntax : rmic RemoteServerClassName)
4) Start Remote Server (start rmiregistry.exe)
5) Register the Remote class object into server (java remoteserverclass)


Client Side :
-------------
6) Copy both Remote Interface and Stub class into client Machine from the server.
7) Create Client Application & use remote server class object in  any client connected in a Remote Server.
